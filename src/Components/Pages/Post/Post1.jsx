            Tramadol 50mg is a centrally acting, synthetic pain reliever. The
            medication is intended for modest to chronic dental pain. The
            analgesic action of the drug affects both serotonin uptake and
            opioid receptor. This indicates that the effect is not primarily
            through a narcotic mechanism. Thus, it is a non-scheduled medicine.
            The side effects while taking the medication for toothache are
            generally linked with opioids like constipation, sedation,
            dependence and respiratory depression. Nevertheless, these adverse
            effects occur less often.

            majority of individuals get diagnosed during their 50s or 60s. This
            condition is likely to be found in old and middle-aged people. On
            the other hand, if people are suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or
            lupus, they are likely to experience fibromyalgia. Though other
            factors have also been mildly associated with this disease, more

            onset of the illness. The potential risk factors include: women are
            more vulnerable to fibromyalgia when compared to men, injury from
            insistent stress, repetitive injuries, traumatic or stressful
            mishaps, viral infections, obesity, and family history.
